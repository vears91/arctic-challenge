Code for the project of team Skellefteall at [Arctic Challenge 2016](http://arcticchallenge.se/)

On November 19 and 20, 2016, we participated in the Arctic Challenge hackathon in Skellefte√•, Sweden, with the objective of developing apps that use augmented reality to benefit several target groups.

Our team developed a solution that uses computer vision to recognize logos, text, and objects and return relevant information to the user in the context of the city, its institutions and businesses. Since we wanted to create an inclusive app, we also added automated computer translation for the benefit of tourists, refugees or other groups that might need such a feature. We outlined the way to use gamification to engage users with the app and the city.
